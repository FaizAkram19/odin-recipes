    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza[a][1] is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven</p>
    <p>The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In 2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (smooth or pureed</li>
        <li>Firm mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>Italian sausage, cooked ahead and crumbled</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Proof the yeast</li>
        <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</li>
        <li>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.</li>
        <li>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.</li>

    </ol>
